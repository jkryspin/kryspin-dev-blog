When I was a kid I found computers to be fascinating. I would come home from school every day and hop onto the computer when my older sister was not using it. My favorite thing to do as a kid was to hack games. My friends back in middle school called me the hacker, they saw me manipulate my rank in call of duty modern warfare 2 to 10th prestige the second week the game was out. I enjoyed creating bots for Runescape that would automatically do menial and monotonous tasks for me so I could go to school and have my character leveling up while I’m learning about the crusades. Little did I know that all of this experience building small programs to cheat in games would lead me to be a Software Engineer at IBM. And little did I know that writing a small bot to kill chickens in Runescape with Java would provide me a base to become the product owner for one of IBM’s many internal applications which just happens to be written in _Java_.

But was it really just this one language that (has so far) led me to be successful?

Let’s look at what other languages I have developed in (in the order I learned them)

Visual Basic:  
I learned Visual Basic as a sophomore in highschool. It was a class with 5 people in total and I absolutely loved it. Apart from the class projects my first self-directed “project” was a calculator interface, much like the one you can use right now on Windows

Javascript/HTML/CSS:

I picked these up easily Freshman year. I built a click through game with my partner. It was abysmal, but I received an A in the class. 4 years later I’m writing production websites for IBM internal use to track employee statistics. I was given an award from my Vice President for innovation for this website.

Python:

A few years ago I dabbled with python and google maps api. As an intern at IBM I was assigned to learn how to create a mobile app to aggregate employee data. I needed a quick way to gather results from Google Maps, so I wrote a python script to gather location data for the geographic latitude and longitude for all of IBM’s major cities we are in. With this data I was able to generate a map with points on it showing the number of employees located in each city. (Don’t worry we are not tracking where a employee currently is, rather their primary work location)

PHP: I found this language to be a bit dull. Even though Facebook runs using PHP I didn’t like the way variables were set and some of the syntax threw me off. Luckily I had only one semester of PHP where I created a website with my partner of a mock class registration system for Marist students.

Java: One of my favorite languages. I learned this in college and have since used it to teach students how to mod Minecraft. My current job role revolves around a lot of Java code, which I am really enjoying.

Swift: What a fantastic language. Unwrapping objects used to be a hatred of mine, but I appreciate that functionality so much now. I used swift to create a iOS app for iPhones managed by IBM.

Do I have a preference for which language I use? Yes, but I would say that the first language you learn has little to no significance on where you go from there. Once I had the core concepts down, I felt like any language was just different syntax and methods. Once I understood visual basic it was easy to transfer that knowledge into other languages.

From creating hacks for multiplayer games as a kid to programming at IBM. Don’t let picking the language be a stopping point. Pick one and you will learn to adapt to any language in any environment.

But really, pick Java ;)
